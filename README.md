    # Summary:
    This board is designed as a small universal FPGA daughterboard that can be added to any project without having to construct a unique layout for each project. It features a 40 pin mezzanine connector to attach to the parent board which offers access to all of the FPGA IO, Clock Hardware Controls, FPGA Configuration controls, and flash programming.

    # Hardware:
    + Lattice ICE40LP384-SG32 FPGA.
    + Winbond W25X40C 4MBit Flash.
    + 16MHz Application configurable FPGA Clock.
    + Configuration done and Power OK status LEDs.
    + 2 User program controlled status LEDs.
    + 2mm Clearance daughterboard mezzanine connector.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Because of the intended small form factor of this board it may be difficult to manufacture for some.

    # TODO:
    - [X] Rough board layout.
    - [ ] Large scale prototype board.
    - [ ] Final schematic review.
    - [ ] First revision prototype assembled.
    - [ ] Prototype rework (Or it works first try?)
    - [ ] All features test.
    - [ ] Project integration.
